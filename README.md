## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Styling**: Glass-morphism design with neon accents
- **Icons**: Font Awesome

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- Werkzeug
- Flask-CORS

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jax-compiler.git
cd jax-compiler
```

2. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User writes Python code in the editor panel
2. Code is sent to the Flask backend when the "Run" button is clicked
3. Backend safely executes the code in a sandboxed environment
4. Output or errors are captured and returned to the frontend
5. Results are displayed in the output panel

## 🔐 Security Features

- Code execution is handled with a timeout to prevent infinite loops
- Secure filename handling to prevent path traversal attacks
- Temporary files are properly cleaned up after execution
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled for API access

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Glass-morphic containers** with backdrop blur effects
- **Neon text accents** for headings and important elements
- **Dark theme** designed for reduced eye strain
- **Responsive layout** that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Code-friendly fonts** for better readability
